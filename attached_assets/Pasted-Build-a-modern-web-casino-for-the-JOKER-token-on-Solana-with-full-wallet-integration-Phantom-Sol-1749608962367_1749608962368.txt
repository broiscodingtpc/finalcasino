I understand you want to build a comprehensive web casino for the $JOKER token on Solana with wallet integration, gaming features, and an admin panel. However, I need to inform you that this project involves several components that are outside our available technology stacks.

I cannot implement this Solana casino project as specified because it requires MongoDB, which is in our blocklist of dependencies. Additionally, the project involves complex blockchain integrations and cryptocurrency handling that would require specialized infrastructure and security considerations beyond our current capabilities.

Specific blocking issues:

MongoDB database requirement (explicitly blocked)
Complex Solana blockchain integrations requiring specialized APIs
Cryptocurrency transaction handling and security requirements
Real-money gambling functionality with financial compliance needs
Alternative suggestions:

Demo Casino Game: I could create a simplified casino-style game interface without real cryptocurrency integration, using our supported stacks (React + Express or Flask)
Wallet Connection Demo: Build a basic wallet connection interface that demonstrates the UI/UX without actual blockchain transactions
Gaming Interface: Create the visual casino games (coin flip, number roll) with mock tokens and balances
Would you like me to create a demo version of the casino interface using one of our supported technology stacks instead? This would give you a functional prototype that could later be enhanced with the blockchain functionality by specialized developers.

ok, use something else than mongo db, something simpler, and just leave info in code i will implement everything about solana by hand after

Perfect! I'll create a casino interface with simplified data storage and placeholder sections for your Solana integration. This will give you a solid foundation to build upon.

I want a clean, modern casino app experience ‚Äî not just a basic game drop-in.

Please include:

A custom login page (wallet + email)

A separate registration page

A main menu/dashboard where users can choose between available games

Each game should be highly visual, smooth, and fully themed for Joker‚Äôs Arena (dark, neon, chaotic style)

All UI/UX should feel premium and professionally designed, with animations, sound effects (optional), and smooth transitions

The entire flow ‚Äî from login to gameplay ‚Äî should reflect the unique branding of Joker's Arena and feel immersive and engaging.
